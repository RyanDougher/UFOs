# UFOs

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to build a dynamic webpage to help analyze data on past UFO sightings. The webpage includes a data table with information on UFO sighting events. Filters are included to help narrow down search criteria. The search criteria includes the date of the event, the city, state, and country where it occurred, and the shape of the object reported.

### Search Criteria and Filters

To search for UFO sightings on a specified date, simply input a date into the "Enter Date" field, in the format m/d/yyyy. The example below shows the data filtered for the date of 1/8/2010.

## Summary

- One drawback of this design is that the search criteria must be entered in a specific format in order to work, and it is case sensitive.
- One recommendation would be to turn the filter fields into dropdown menus in order to remove the risk of user error.
- Including a button to clear the filters would improve the efficiency of this webpage.
