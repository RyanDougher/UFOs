# UFOs

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to build a dynamic webpage to help analyze data on past UFO sightings. The webpage includes a data table with information on UFO sighting events. Filters are included to help narrow down search criteria. The search criteria includes the date of the event, the city, state, and country where it occurred, and the shape of the object reported.

## Results

### Link to UFO Sightings webpage

The webpage can be found at https://ryandougher.github.io/UFOs/

The link above will take you to this initial page.



### Search Criteria and Filters

The table on the mainpage presents all of the collective data included in this analysis. One can specify their data search using the filter criteria to the left of the table.

To search for UFO sightings on a specified date, simply input a date into the "Enter Date" field, in the format m/d/yyyy. The example below shows the data filtered for the date of 1/8/2010.



To search for sightings in a specific city, input the city name into the "Enter City" field.



Input an abbreviated state code, in lower case, into the "Enter State" field to search for sightings in a certain state.



Input the abbrevaition of a country in the "Enter Country" field to search for sightings in a specific country.



You can also enter search criteria for the shape of the UFO object in the "Enter Shape" field.



## Summary

- One drawback of this design is that the search criteria must be entered in a specific format in order to work, and it is case sensitive.
- One recommendation would be to turn the filter fields into dropdown menus in order to remove the risk of user error.
- Including a button to clear the filters would improve the efficiency of this webpage.
